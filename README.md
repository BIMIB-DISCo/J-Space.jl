# SPACE-SIM
# INTRODUCTION 
SPACE-SIM is a Julia package to simulate the genomic evolution and the spatial growth of a cell population and the procedure of sequencing the genome of the sampled cells. SPACE-SIM operate under a broad set of different conditions, phenomenological rules and experimental setting.
Firstly, the software simulates the spatial dynamics of the cells as a continuous-time multi-type birth-death stochastic process on a graph employing different rules of interaction and an optimised Gillespie algorithm. 
Finally, after mimicking a spatial sampling of the tumour cells, SPACE-SIM  returns the phylogenetic tree of the sample and simulate molecular evolution of the genome under the a infinite-site models or a set of different substitution models  with the possibility to include structural variants as the indels. Finally, employing ART, SPACE-SIM   generate the  synthetic  single-end, paired-end/mate-pair reads of three  next-generation sequencing platforms.
