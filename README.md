# J-SPACE 
## INTRODUCTION 
J-SPACE is a Julia package to simulate the spatial growth and the genomic evolution  of a cell population and the experiment of sequencing the genome of the sampled cells.
Firstly, the software simulates the spatial dynamics of the cells as a continuous-time multi-type birth-death stochastic process on a graph employing different rules of interaction and an optimised Gillespie algorithm. 
After mimicking a spatial sampling of the tumour cells, J-SPACE  returns the phylogenetic tree of the sample and simulates molecular evolution of the genome under the infinite-site models or a set of different substitution models. Ther is also  the possibility of include indels. Finally, employing ART, J-SPACE generates the  synthetic single-end, paired-/mate-pair end reads of the next-generation sequencing platforms.


 ### Spatial clonal dynamics
 In J-SPACE the dynamics of the spatio-temporal evolution of a tumour is modelled by a stochastic multi-type Birth-Death process over an
arbitrary graph. J-SPACE could generate by itself a 2D or 3D regular lattice. In addition, it is possible to give as input any graph as an adjacency matrix ( an example of the format needed for this matrix is given in path "xxxxxx", descrizione breve formato). 
In this part, the user can tune the birth rate of wild type cells, the death rate of the cells, the rate of migration of cells (not tested), the rule of contact between cells, the probability to develop a driver mutation per division, and the average birth rate advantage of a driver mutation.
Note that every rate inserted in J-SPACE must have the same unit of time both for the spatial dynamics and the molecular evolution.  

 ### Molecular evolution
 
J-SPACE simulate the evolution of the sequence of the sample after the simulation of the clonal dynamics. The user can sample the whole population or a subset of it, and the J-SPACE evaluate the phylogenetic tree of the samples. This GT tree is returned as a Newick file in the folder specified by the variable "/path_to_save_files/" .  

The molecular evolution of an ancestral genome  (which can be given by the user as FASTA file or generated randomly) is simulated along the sampled tree via the Doob-Gillespie algorithm.
The user can use an infinite-site model to have fast simulations of situations where the genome is long, the mutational rate is very low (e.g.,<10^-8 substitution for unit of time), and the total simulated time is long.

In the case of finite-site models, J-SPACE takes as input the matrix of instantaneous rates for different substitution models: JC69, F81, K80, HKY85, TN93, and K81.
We suppose that the indels have a size distributed as  a Lavalette distribution.
 Note that using finite-site for long genomes come at the cost of computational performance.
 After this computation, the sequences of the samples (i.e., the leafs of the phylogenetic tree) are returned as FASTA file in the folder  /"path_to_save_files"/Fasta output/
 
 

 ### Sequencing experiment

To simulate the reads of a sequencing experiment J-SPACE calls ART (https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/resources/software/biostatistics/art/index.cfm). The user can use a configuration file to specify the error model (for Illumina platforms), the number of reads, the length of the reads, and if the experiment uses single-end paired-end/mate-pair reads.
In addition, in the configuration file, there is the option to insert custom "calls" for ART  with the possibility to use it in any possible configuration.
If the user simulate the experiment, \alg{} returns for each cell, the simulated reads as FASTQ file, the alignment map of the reads over the genome of the sampled cells in SAM and/or ALN format. 
If the infinite-site model is used,  it is possible to obtain the VCF file directly without simulating the reads with ART.
## REQUIRED  SOFTWARE AND PACKAGE
- Operating system: Linux 
- Julia (https://julialang.org/) Version 1.6.3 or higher
- ART, install it from https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/resources/software/biostatistics/art/index.cfm

The J-SPACE can be downloaded from Github. To do so, we need to install the Julia from https://julialang.org/.   
Fist the user need to copy the project folder in the chosen working directory. To install J-SPACE follow the steps:
1. Using REPL or the COMMAND LINE move to the working directory.  
2. If you use the COMMAND LINE, to start a Julia session run the command:

> julia

3. To enter in the Pkg REPL  type 

>]  

4. Type the command 
> activate .

5. To activate the J-SPACE project, type
> instantiate
	


## RUN J-SPACE

### RUN A SINGLE SIMULATION
The parameters and the configuration of the simulation are managment by the user by modifing the files "Parameters.toml" and "Config.toml" (the name of the file is not mandatory),  that are detailed in the next sections.  
To run a simulation of J-SPACE using the ".toml" file for the paramet follow the following step:

1. Load the J-SPACE package using:
> using J_Space  

2. Start the simulation
> Start_J_Space("Parameters.toml","Config.toml")  


NOTE: the simulation does not start if in the working folder are absent the two .toml files. 

### RUN THE EXAMPLES
To run the examples, in the main folder of J-SPACE, from command line digit 
> julia --project=.  ./path/myscript.jl

  -  The Ground Truth (GT) genotype of the sampled cells as FASTA files.
  - The GT phylogenetic  tree  of the sampled cells in Newick format.
  -   The plot of the mutational tree of the driver mutations (if present).

  -   The simulated next-generation sequencing reads as FASTQ files in the folder "/"path_to_save_files"/Fasta output/sample_#", where sample_# is the #-th sample.
  -  The alignment file, which maps the noisy reads on the sequences of the sampled cells both in formats SAM and ALN.
  -   The alignment file, whithout noise in format SAM.
